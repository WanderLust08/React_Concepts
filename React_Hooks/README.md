## React Hooks
* A hook is function that gives you access to React's internal Memory and allow you to hook into the features of React state and lifecycle from function components.
* Hooks do not function inside classes, and needless to say no one uses classes in React in 2024. You gain access to a value and a command to modify this value. (UseState)

This folder contains the working of all the Major Hooks present in React.


***P.S : I am still learning and adding the Hooks one by one. Stay Tuned. ðŸ˜„***
